## How to Publish Catalyse

1. Catalyse follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), as such before we publish we need to increment appropriately for either the MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH version in `package.json`
2. Run the following: `npm publish`
3. Check if your version has been upgraded in [Github](https://github.com/users/Michaelomh/packages/npm/package/catalyse)
